phpInsight - Sentiment Analysis in PHP
=========
---------

**v0.1**

phpInsight is a sentiment classifier. It uses a dictionary of words that are categorised as positive, negative or neutral and a naive bayes algorithm to calculate sentiment. To improve accuracy phpInsight removes 'noise' words to improve accuracy. 

phpInsight grew out of a tutorial from http://phpir.com/bayesian-opinion-mining
